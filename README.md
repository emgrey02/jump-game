## What I Learned
- how to use a setInterval() function to run a function every 10ms
- I can use clearInterval(function) to stop the setInterval() function from running
- window.getComputedStyle was very helpful to retrieve location values (rather than offsetLeft, etc.)
- window.location.reload() refreshes the window
- difference between calling a function like this _jump()_ versus _jump_
- how to use CSS clip path to make these shapes
